* Description
As the default wakatime layer doesn't support:
- getting wakatime binary from PATH, which makes easy for multi platform like in
  Windows, or Mac.
- reading key from .wakatime.cfg. I don't want to push my wakatime key to repo.
* Install
To use this contribution add it to your =~/.spacemacs=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(my-wakatime))
#+end_src

You need to:
- Check `which wakatime-script.py', make sure it can be found in your $PATH.
- Prepare your ~/.wakatime.cfg. Here is an example of this config file: https://github.com/wakatime/wakatime#troubleshooting
